| **playerId** | **kotlin.String** | The unique identifier of the player |  |
| **playerScore** | **kotlin.Double** | The player score in this match Default: 0 It&#39;s up to the game to determine this value. The only requirement is that a higher score is better than a lower score. This value only matters if player performance is configured to have non-zero weight. |  |

| **partyId** | **kotlin.String** | Local identifier of the player&#39;s party. If set, should be unique per party per match. Default behavior is to treat each player as their own party, so party_id can be omitted for games that don&#39;t support parties. |  [optional] |

| **playerScoreStart** | **kotlin.Double** | The player&#39;s score at the start of this session (advanced option) Default behavior is to inherit player_score from the end of the previous session (recommended) Used for score-per-minute normalization in cases where players can rejoin matches e.g. set this to 0 if player scores are reset on rejoin |  [optional] |
| **priorGamesPlayed** | **kotlin.Long** | The previous number of games the player has played (ever, or just this season). |  [optional] |

| **teamId** | **kotlin.String** | Local identifier of the player&#39;s team. If set must match one of the teams provided in the [[MatchResult]]. Default behavior is to treat each player as their own team, so team_id can be omitted for 1v1 or free-for-all modes. |  [optional] |
